# Relational Operators

A conditional statement (also known as a Boolean expression) is used to tell NetLinx whether or not to execute a particular function or functions in the program.

The Relational Operators are listed below:

|          |                          |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Operator | Function                 |
| \<       | Less Than                |
| \>       | Greater Than             |
| =        | Equal To                 |
| ==       | Equal To                 |
| \<=      | Less Than or Equal To    |
| \>=      | Greater Than or Equal To |
| \<\>     | Not Equal To             |
