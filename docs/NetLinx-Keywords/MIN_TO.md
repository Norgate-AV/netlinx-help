# MIN_TO

This keyword operates just like the [TO](TO.md) keyword, except that the
specified channel or variable stays on for a minimum length of time, even if the
corresponding channel is released.

- The minimum length of time is set by [SET_PULSE_TIME](SET_PULSE_TIME.md).
- MIN_TO follows the same conditions of operation as the TO keyword.
