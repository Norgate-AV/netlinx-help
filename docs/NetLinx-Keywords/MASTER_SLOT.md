# MASTER_SLOT

This system variable represents the number of the slot in which the master card
is plugged into – "0" is the primary master and "1" is the secondary master.

NetLinx systems have only one master, so MASTER_SLOT in NetLinx is always "0".

Note: This keyword is primarily associated with Axcess systems.
