# Compiler Directives

Compiler Directives are special types of instructions for the compiler. They won't produce any runtime code. Instead, they allow you to instruct the compiler to conditionally compile parts of the code.

The NetLinx language supports the following Compiler Directives:

- [\#DEFINE](_DEFINE.md)

- [\#END_IF](_END_IF.md)

- [\#ELSE](_ELSE.md)

- [\#IF_DEFINED](_IF_DEFINED.md)

- [\#IF_NOT_DEFINED](_IF_NOT_DEFINED.md)

- [\#INCLUDE](_INCLUDE.md)

- [\#WARN](_WARN.md)
