# Logical Operators

Logical Operators compare two conditions or, in the case of [NOT](NOT_.md) , invert one condition (also known as Boolean Operators).

A true or false result is produced.

The Logical Operators are listed below:

|          |             |                 |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Operator | Function    | Keyword         |
| &&       | Logical And | [AND](AND_.md) |
| \|\|     | Logical Or  | [OR](OR_.md)   |
| ^^       | Logical XOR | [XOR](XOR_.md) |
| !        | Logical Not | [NOT](NOT_.md) |
