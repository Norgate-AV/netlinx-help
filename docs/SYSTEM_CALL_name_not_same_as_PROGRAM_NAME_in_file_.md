# SYSTEM_CALL name not same as PROGRAM_NAME in <file>

This error occurs when a library file is compiled and the name of the subroutine in the library file does not match the [PROGRAM_NAME](PROGRAM_NAME.md) string on the first line of the file.

Note: Unlike Compiler Warnings, Compiler Errors must be corrected before your NetLinx program can be executed.
