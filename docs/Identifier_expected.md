# Identifier expected

The compiler is expecting an identifier after a [\#DEFINE](_DEFINE.md) statement or after an integer declaration in the [DEFINE_VARIABLE](DEFINE_VARIABLE.md) section.

Note: Unlike Compiler Warnings, Compiler Errors must be corrected before your NetLinx program can be executed.
