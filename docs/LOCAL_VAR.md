# LOCAL_VAR

The keyword LOCAL_VAR specifies a variable that is static.

A static variable’s value is initialized the first time the statement block in which it is declared is executed and retained after execution of the statement block has finished.

Note: To provide compatibility with the Axcess language, local variables may be declared right before the opening brace for [DEFINE_CALL](javascript:void(0);) declarations only.
