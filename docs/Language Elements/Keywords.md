# Keywords

A keyword defines the operation to perform in a NetLinx command, such as the word [CALL](CALL.md) in the statement:

CALL 'Read Data' (Buffer)

- Keywords are case insensitive.

- For example, the command PUSH is the same as PUSH and the data type INTEGER is the same as integer.

- Keywords are reserved, meaning that identifiers (device names, constants or variables) may not be defined with the same name.

- Each keyword reserved by the NetLinx compiler is listed below along with an explanation regarding its purpose and usage.

Note:  NetLinx specific functions must always be accompanied by parenthesis, even if there are no parameters.

Example:  

GET_SYSTEM_NUMBER()
