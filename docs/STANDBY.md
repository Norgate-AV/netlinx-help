# STANDBY

This keyword defines a section in a [DATA event handler](Data_Events.md) for processing STANDBY notifications.  

This event is triggered when the master recognizes that a device on the bus has gone into a STANDBY state.  

While in standby state, all communication to the device from the master is dropped.
