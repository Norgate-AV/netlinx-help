# FOR

This keyword is used to define a [FOR loop](FOR_loops.md).

- The looping structure allows you to define initialization statements, statements to execute after each pass through the loop and a condition to test after each pass.
-  If the condition evaluates to true, another pass is made; otherwise the loop is terminated.

Syntax:

```c linenums="1"
FOR (\<INITIAL\>; \<condition\>; \<after pass\>)

{

  (\* for loop statements \*)

}

```
