# Out of memory

The compiler has run out of memory.

Free up memory either by removing any pop-up programs or drivers, by using extended memory, or by breaking your program into one or more Include files.

Note: Unlike Compiler Warnings, Compiler Errors must be corrected before your NetLinx program can be executed.
