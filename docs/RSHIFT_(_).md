# RSHIFT (\>\>)

This [Bitwise Operator](Bitwise_operators.md) causes the bits in the associated integer field to be shifted right. This has the effect of dividing by 2n where n is the number of bit positions to shift.

Note: The symbol \>\> is equivalent to RSHIFT.

For example,

INT2 = INT1 RSHIFT 2

is equivalent to

INT2 = INT1 \>\> 2

Both statements shift INT1 right two positions.

Either statement could be replaced with

INT2 = INT1 / 4
