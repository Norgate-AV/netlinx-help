# Custom Events

A custom event is generated by certain devices in response to query commands or unique device events. For instance, G4 touch panels generate custom events in response to button query commands or mouse clicks.

An example channel event is shown below:

CUSTOM_EVENT\[DEVICE,ID,TYPE\] or CUSTOM_EVENT\[DEVCHAN,EVENTID\]

{

}

The EVENTID is specific to each device. For instance, the EVENTID sent in response to a button text query command for G4 touch panels is 1001. For more information on EVENTID values and the values of the custom event for each EVENTID, see the programming section of the device manual with which you are working.

The following table lists the information contained in Custom events:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Property Name | Type | Description |
| Custom.Device | [DEV](DEV.md) | Device |
| Custom.Device.Number | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | Device number |
| Custom.Device.Port | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | Device port |
| Custom.Device.System | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | System number |
| Custom.ID | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | The ID of the custom event as defined by the device |
| Custom.Type | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | The TYPE of the custom event as defined by the device |
| Custom.Flag | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | A flag associated with the event |
| Custom.Value1 | [SLONG](SLONG.md) | The first value associated with the event |
| Custom.Value2 | [SLONG](SLONG.md) | The second value associated with the event |
| Custom.Value3 | [SLONG](SLONG.md) | The third value associated with the event |
| Custom.Text | [CHAR\[ \]](CHAR.htm) | Text associated with the event |
| Custom.Encode | [CHAR\[ \]](CHAR.htm) | A string encoded with VARIABLE_TO_STRING encoding for complex data types. |
| Custom.SourceDev | [DEV](DEV.md) | Source device of custom event |
| Custom.SourceDev.Number | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | Source device number |
| Custom.SourceDev.Port | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | Source device port |
| Custom.SourceDev.System | [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) | Source device system. |

If the event handler is specified using an array for DEV, INTEGER, or a DEVCHAN array, [GET_LAST](GET_LAST.md) can determine which index in the array caused the event to run.
