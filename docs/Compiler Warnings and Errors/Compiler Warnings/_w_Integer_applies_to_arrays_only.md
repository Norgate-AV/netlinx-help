# (w) Integer applies to arrays only

This warning appears when the keyword [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) is applied to a
non-array type of variable.

Doing this is not an error, because non-array variables are already integers,
but it is redundant.

Note: Compiler Warnings, unlike Compiler Errors, do not stop the program from
compiling.
