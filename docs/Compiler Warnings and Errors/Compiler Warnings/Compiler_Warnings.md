# Compiler Warnings

Sometimes the compiler generates a warning message instead of an error message;
these warning messages always start with w.

- A warning about a particular statement means that the statement is not
  technically an error, but you should be careful doing it.

- Compiler Warnings, unlike Compiler Errors, do not stop the program from
  compiling.
