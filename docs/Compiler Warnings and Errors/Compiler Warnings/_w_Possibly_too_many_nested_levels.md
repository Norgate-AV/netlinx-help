# (w) Possibly too many nested levels

This warning appears if there is a large amount of nesting in the program.

This can happen with a long chain of IF...ELSE [IF statements](IF.md). The solution is to use the [SELECT...ACTIVE](SELECT_ACTIVE.md) set of statements.

Note: Compiler Warnings, unlike Compiler Errors, do not stop the program from compiling.
