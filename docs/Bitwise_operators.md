# Bitwise Operators

Bitwise Operators are keywords or symbols that perform a bit-by-bit operation
between two items.

The Bitwise Operators are listed below:

|          |             |                             |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Operator | Function    | Keyword                     |
| &        | Bitwise And | [BAND](BAND_.md)            |
| \|       | Bitwise Or  | [BOR](BOR_.md)              |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR | [BXOR](BXOR_.md)            |
| ~        | Bitwise Not | [BNOT](BNOT_.md)            |
| \<\<     | Shift Left  | [LSHIFT](<LSHIFT_(__).htm>) |
| \>\>     | Shift Right | [RSHIFT](<RSHIFT_(_).htm>)  |
