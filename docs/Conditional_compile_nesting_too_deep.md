# Conditional compile nesting too deep

There are too many nested [\#IF\_DEFINED](_IF_DEFINED.md) or [\#IF\_NOT\_DEFINED](_IF_NOT_DEFINED.md) conditional compilation statements.

The limit is 20 nested conditional compilation statements.

Note: Unlike Compiler Warnings, Compiler Errors must be corrected before your NetLinx program can be executed.
