# Type mismatch in function CALL

A function was called with a parameter of the wrong type.

For instance, attempting to use [ITOA](ITOA.md) with an array as a parameter will result in an error.

Note: Unlike Compiler Warnings, Compiler Errors must be corrected before your NetLinx program can be executed.
