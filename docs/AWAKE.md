# AWAKE

This keyword defines a section in a [DATA event handler](DATA_EVENT.md) for processing AWAKE notifications.

- This event is triggered when the master recognizes that a device on the bus has exited [STANDBY](STANDBY.md) state.  
- Once the device is AWAKE, communication to the device from the master can resume.
