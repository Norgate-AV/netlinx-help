# VOLATILE

This keyword is used as part of a variable declaration to specify that storage space for the variable be allocated in volatile memory.

Variables stored in volatile memory are not retained when the system is powered down as are variables stored in non-volatile memory. The trade-off is that volatile memory is generally more plentiful and therefore a good choice for storing large data arrays.
