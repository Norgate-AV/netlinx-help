# ONLINE

This keyword defines a section in a [DATA event handler](DATA_EVENT.md) for processing ONLINE notifications.

This is an important aspect of the DATA_EVENT that is triggered when the master recognizes that a device has been added to the bus.

 In NetLinx, every device triggers an ONLINE event when the master is reset, this not only ensures that the device is initialized on startup but that the device is initialized anytime the device comes online.
