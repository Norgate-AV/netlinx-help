# Array Keywords

An [array](Arrays.md) is data structure that stores a collection of individual values that are of the same data type.

The NetLinx language allows arrays of any [Data Type](Data_Type_Keywords.md) supported by the language as well as arrays of user-defined structures and classes.

NetLinx supports the following Array keywords:

- [`LENGTH_ARRAY`](LENGTH_ARRAY.md)
- [`MAX_LENGTH_ARRAY`](MAX_LENGTH_ARRAY.md)
- [`SET_LENGTH_ARRAY`](SET_LENGTH_ARRAY.md)
